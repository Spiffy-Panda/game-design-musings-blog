## 2026-06-24 — Bootstrap: scaffold + landing-page site + Pages deploy

**Context:** Fresh repo for miscellaneous game-design musings and exploration (named
after a Godot directory, but not Godot-specific). Initialized per the bootstrap skill
`initialize-skill-v0_2.md`. First real task bundled in: a Python preview server + a
landing page that acts as a directory to future projects, plus a GitHub Actions
workflow to publish it to GitHub Pages.

**Options considered:**
- *Repo shape:* code-bearing (stand up `src/` + `CodeDocs/` + `CODE-DESIGN.md`) vs
  prose/knowledge-base + tooling (skip the code-doc tier).
- *Landing page:* hand-authored `index.html` vs a data-driven generator that rebuilds
  the index from per-project metadata.
- *Publishing:* deploy-from-branch Pages vs GitHub Actions Pages deploy.
- *Preview server location:* `src/` (product code) vs `utils/` (durable tooling).

**Choice:** Prose/KB + tooling shape — no `src/`, no `CodeDocs/`. Deliverables are
written explorations surfaced via the static site (`site/`, a README + SITE.md
deliverable pair); the only code is a local preview server placed at
`utils/python/serve.py` and cataloged in `utils/README.md`. Hand-authored `index.html`
for v1 (generator deferred — see `plans/PLAN-blog-site.md`). Publish via GitHub Actions
(`.github/workflows/pages.yml`) uploading `site/` as a Pages artifact.

**Why:** The product here is content, not a program; the server is tooling, so the
code-doc tier would be ceremony with nothing to mirror. A hand-authored page is the
"basic" thing asked for and stays robust with zero projects; the generator is a clean
follow-up once real musings exist. Actions-based Pages is the current first-class path
and keeps `site/` the single source of truth (the same folder the local server previews).

**Notes:**
- `scrap_scripts/` is gitignored *except* its `README.md`, so the scratch-script
  convention ships with the repo while throwaway scripts stay local.
- Site links are **relative** so the page works both locally (served at `/`) and on
  Pages (served under `/game-design-musings-blog/`).
- Identity gate (Rule 6/7): git author is `Spiffy-Panda <CptSpiffyPanda@gmail.com>` —
  pseudonymous, no dead/real-name leak — so the public push is clean.
- One-time manual step: set GitHub Pages source to "GitHub Actions" (repo Settings →
  Pages) for the workflow to publish.
